    "# Gradient Boosting Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithm trains a series of weak learners and each focuses on the errors the previous learners have made and tries to improve it. Together, they make a better prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia, Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion as other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. \n",

    "Here the picture looks more complicated than the one on regression. The purple ones are log of odds (**l**). The green ones are probabilities. We firstly calculate log of odds of **y**, instead of average. We then calculate probabilities using log of odds. We build a regression tree. The leaves are colored green. The leaves have residuals. We use the probability residuals to produce log-of-odds residuals or $\\gamma$. $\\gamma$ is then used to update **l**. This continues until we are satisfied with the results or we are running out of iterations.\n",
