    "The Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithm trains a series of weak learners and each focuses on the errors the previous learners have made and tries to improve it. Together, they make a better prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia, Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion as other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. \n",
